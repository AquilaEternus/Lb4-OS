Notes:
	The C-LOOK scheduler was tested using the bash script "tester.sh",
	which echo's the names of the files/directories in the current 
	directory to a file named "testdata" and then reads from that file 
	and echo's the contents line by line to the terminal.

How to Test C-LOOK Scheduler using:

Step 0: Make sure to be in the same directory as the "boot", "bin", 
	"sys" directories, etc.
Step 1: Run "dmesg -C" to the clear log if needed.
Step 2: Run "bash tester.sh"
Step 3: Run "dmesg > results" to pipe the output of dmesg to a file 
	named results.
Step 4: If going to run again, remove the "results" and "testdata" files 
	with rm command.
